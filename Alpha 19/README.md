**Finished mods have a "A19 - " prefix, works in progress don't.**

## Current Modlets
- **Ammo Stacks 3x**: Multiplies stack sizes for ammunition by 3x. 
- **Better Forge Materials**: Adds recipes for converting forge materials into quick-smelt versions (100 units/s) and back to regular forge materials.
- **Better Silencers**: Further reduces the sound of silenced weapons. Much more of a "movie silencer" than a real silencer.
- **Better Starting Inventory**: I wanted a stronger start for nomadic playthroughs, so I added a starting bundle that gives the player a big head start and uses a different scenario for the beginning of the game other than you didn't "pay up" and got left for dead in the wild. If desired, a version using the entrenching tool (see below) instead of the usual pick/axe/shovel combo is provided.
- **Copy Schematics**: When you read a schematic, perk book, or buy ranks, it also unlocks a crafting recipe for the schematic itself, costing three paper, craftable in the backpack. There's an option at the top of items.xml to allow/disallow the selling of schematics to traders.
- **Entrenching Tool**: Adds Iron and Steel entrenching tools. Functions as a pickaxe/fireaxe/shovel combo, with increased crafting costs compared to regular tools. Doesn't perform as well as the actual tool, but better than the wrong tool (e.g., worse than a pickaxe on metal, better than a fireaxe on metal).
- **Extra Item Mods**: Adds some extra item mods to the game. See the readme in the mod folder for a full listing of the mods.
- **Fatal Headshots**: Makes all headshots with projectiles instantly fatal.
- **Free Relays**: Makes the electrical relay, switch, and tripwire cost 0W instead of 1W.
- **L6 Crafting**: Allows players to craft L6 versions of items given the relevant crafting skill is maxed.
- **Level Faster**: Increases skill points per level, reduces XP needed to level, reduces the rate at which XP requirements grow.
- **Money Stacks**: Increases stack size for coins, adds a "Compressed Coin" item and recipe for interconversion (10,000 coins <-> 1 Compressed Coin). Compressed coins can be smelted 
- **No Boiled Water Dysentery**: Removes the chance for dysentery from boiled water.
- **Only Zombie Spawns**: Only allows zombies and zombie animals to spawn. Regular animals spawns are replaced with zombie or zombie animal spawns.
- **Two Extra 4x4 Seats**: Adds two seats to the back bumper of the 4x4.
- **Vehicles Enhanced**: Increases speed and fuel efficiency for the 4x4, gyro, and motorcycle. Adds an extra seat to the motorcycle, two extra seats to the gyro.
- **Weapon Damage 5x**: Multiplies all player (but not zombie) entity weapon damage by 5.

## Needs Testing
- **Beaker Recipe**: Adds a crafting recipe for the beaker to the forge, unlocked at L3 of Advanced Engineering.
- **Repair Wrench**: Adds the repair functionality to the wrench's secondary use (default: right-click).
- **Solar Crafting**: Allows the crafting of solar banks, solar cells, photovoltaic(PV) material, and the old electronic parts. Solar cell quality controlled by the 'Advanced Engineering' perk. Only learnable from the schematic.

## Works in progress
- **~~Adventure Mod~~**: Currently no way to send players to specific POIs or even specific classes of POIs. Can't have an adventure if players can't be sent to specific places. ~~Name is a placeholder. My attempt to create a "story" for players to play through on random maps. Currently being designed for very large (16k), wasteland only, water border maps. Assumes the map is using the COMPOPACK42 POI pack. See the readme in the folder for more information.~~
- **Faster Gyro Reverse**: Trying to increase the gyrocopter's reverse speed when on the ground, to make maneuvering easier.
- **Vehicles Mods**: Adds mods for vehicles. Currently vehicles have slots for mods, but no vehicle mods are currently implemented. There seems to be issues with what passive_effects are implemented. This is currently a placeholder for when those features are implemented.
