# 7DTD-Modlets
Modlets are organized by which version of the game they are for. Most of the mods are updated when a new version comes out. Each version folder has a readme detailing the mods for that version. The current version of 7 Days to Die is: `Alpha 18`.

Server admins: clients will need to have the mod in their mod directory to see the localizations. The mods will be usable without them, but may not be as clear about their use.

Localization for all mods is a WIP.
All modlets are free to use, but not distribute. Please leave the ModInfo.xml file intact.
